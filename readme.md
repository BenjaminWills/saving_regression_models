# Saving ML models for future use

In this repository I explored a method of saving a ML model, using the `pickle` library. 

## Instructions

When in the parent directory run the following command:

```sh
python regressor.py --file_path <filepath>
```

To save to your `file_path` of choice. Then to load your file, simply run the following command:

```sh
python load_regressor.py --file_path <filepath>
```

Alternatively, run the following command:

```sh
zsh ./running_script.sh
```
